jQuery Placeholder Plugin
-------------------------

This is a small jQuery plugin that emulates the placeholder attribute in web browsers that do not support it. If the browser does support it, the plugin does nothing.

To use the plugin, add the JS and CSS files to your page and do the following:

    jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
        $(":input[placeholder]").placeholder();
    });

Then, in your HTML you can use the placeholder plugin as documented in the HTML5 spec:

    <input type="search" placeholder="Search..." />
